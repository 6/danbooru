CRITICAL

* Note translation mode. Click-and-drag to create a new note box.
* Note translation locking. When a post is locked, either prevent note edits by other users or notify them somehow. Should be timestamped so if someone fails to unlock a post it won't stay locked forever.
* Move help pages to the wiki.


IMPORTANT

* Require users to enter their password for some sensitive actions.
* Ability to change your account name.
* Ability to close your account.
* Protection against mass assignment.
* Eliminate password cookies.
* Replace parent/child relationships with anonymous pools. Each post would have a related posts field. This would drive the creation of an anonymous pool.
* Use a SSL cert for the login page.
* Ability to copy all notes from one post to another.
* Single post pagination mode.
* Ability to pull related tags from the wiki.


NICE TO HAVE

* Improved pool ordering interface.
* Ability to link users using dtext.
* Ability to highlight pools that have been updated since your last visit.
* Image similarity search integration.
* Ability to search post versions by tags.
* Tag autocompletion.
* Better formatting on comment/forum post preview so that the widths match the actual page.
* Searching for comments by tags.
* Face detection script (http://anime.udp.jp/face-detect)
* Use tf-idf to calculate tag relevance (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf)
* Upload progress meter (http://github.com/masterzen/nginx-upload-progress-module)
* Ajax upload form (http://valums.com/ajax-upload)


MAYBE

* Someone here mentioned the idea of tying tags to notes. I think this is the best way of clustering tags together on a post. I probably won't take a crack at this until after the initial deployment but it's something to keep in mind.
